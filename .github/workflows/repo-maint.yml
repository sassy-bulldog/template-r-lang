# Description: This workflow is used to maintain the repository by:
# closing stale issues and PRs that have not had any update in 10-days,
# locking issues and PRs that have been closed for 60-days,
# and marking issues and PRs older than 90-days as stale.
# All of these settings can be adjusted below.
